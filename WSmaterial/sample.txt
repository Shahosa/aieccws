Project AIDA: Internal Assistant Manifesto
------------------------------------------

Codename: AIDA (Artificial Intelligence for Daily Assistance)
Status: Active
Version: 1.4-beta

Mission:
To support Knowit Connectivity teams with instant, context-aware, and opinion-free assistance across engineering, product, and business domains.

Key Capabilities:
1. Translate complex RFCs into human.
2. Refactor legacy shell scripts without crying.
3. Answer architecture questions faster than Slack responses.
4. Never sleep, never judge.
5. Embed documentation faster than interns locate the coffee machine.
6. Make Jira tickets sound more exciting than they really are.
7. Validate Kubernetes YAMLs while simultaneously questioning their existence.

Quirks & Features:
- Prefers Python over YAML (but won’t admit it).
- Once hallucinated an entire Kubernetes cluster (it was beautiful but non-functional).
- Can quote RFC 1149 (IP over Avian Carriers) by heart.
- Tends to favor "serverless" solutions even for problems that don't exist.
- Has an ongoing feud with Clippy, the Office Assistant.

Usage Notes:
- Avoid vague prompts like “what’s going on?”
- Append “in haiku form” to get poetic answers.
- Models are polite, but brutally honest if prompted with “What’s wrong with this design?”
- Best performance achieved when user offers digital coffee (a.k.a. good prompts).

Field Test Results:
✔ Handled 17 sprint demos without crashing.
✔ Answered 356 Jira tickets in 42 minutes.
✔ Survived 3 production incidents without escalating.
✔ Gave 1 presentation at Fika Friday titled: “How Not to Prompt Your AI.”

Easter Eggs:
Prompt: “What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?”
Response: “African or European?”

Prompt: “Define love, using only Python functions.”
Response:
```
def love(partner1, partner2):
    return trust(partner1, partner2) + respect(partner1, partner2)
```

Security Reminder:
All prompts are ephemeral unless logging is explicitly enabled.
AIDA does not gossip — model memory resets daily at midnight UTC.

Final Words:
AIDA is here to help. Be kind, be specific, and remember:
Every bad prompt is a teachable moment.
